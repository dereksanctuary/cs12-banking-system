# c++ banking system (console application)

a complete console-based banking system built in c++ that allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and store account data using persistent file storage.

---

## why?

the following demonstrates real-world software logic using core computer science fundamentals such as:
- data structures
- file i/o
- object-oriented programming
- control flow
- user input validation

it simulates how real banking software handles users, balances, and transactions.

---

## features

- create customer bank accounts  
- deposit money into accounts  
- withdraw money with balance validation  
- view account details  
- persistent file storage (accounts saved between runs)  
- menu-driven console interface  
- error handling for invalid inputs  

---

## functionality

1. the program starts with a main banking menu  
2. users can:
   - open a new account  
   - deposit funds  
   - withdraw funds  
   - view balance and account information  
3. all account data is stored using file handling  
4. balances persist even after the program is closed  
5. transaction logic prevents invalid withdrawals
